# VRehab
VRehab - an immersive VR Physical Rehabilitation tool that gamifies the recovery process in an attempt to improve the experience for patients with upper body injuries/limitations. This was a year-long final project for my Bachelors Degree where I had to focus on the ever-evolving world of Human-Computer-Interaction.
